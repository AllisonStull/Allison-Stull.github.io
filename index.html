<div>This is probably the greatest thing to happen in my life - to be able to share this with you. If we're going to have animals around we all have to be concerned about them and take care of them. Let's get wild today. La- da- da- da- dah. Just be happy. Isn't it fantastic that you can change your mind and create all these happy things? In your world you have total and absolute power.

    Just think about these things in your mind and drop em' on canvas. Don't forget to tell these special people in your life just how special they are to you. For the lack of a better word I call them hangy downs. All you need is a dream in your heart, and an almighty knife.

    If you hypnotize it, it will go away. It's beautiful - and we haven't even done anything to it yet. Let's just drop a little Evergreen right here. Trees grow in all kinds of ways. They're not all perfectly straight. Not every limb is perfect.

    Take your time. Speed will come later. I'm sort of a softy, I couldn't shoot Bambi except with a camera. You got your heavy coat out yet? It's getting colder. Let your imagination be your guide. Work that paint. I guess I'm a little weird. I like to talk to trees and animals. That's okay though; I have more fun than most people.

    Let's build some happy little clouds up here. A big strong tree needs big strong roots. Nice little fluffy clouds laying around in the sky being lazy. All kinds of happy little splashes.

    In your imagination you can go anywhere you want. If you do too much it's going to lose its effectiveness. Just let these leaves jump off the brush Little trees and bushes grow however makes them happy. That's what painting is all about. It should make you feel good when you paint. Just relax and let it flow. That easy.

    We'll throw some old gray clouds in here just sneaking around and having fun. All you need to paint is a few tools, a little instruction, and a vision in your mind. I'll go over the colors one more time that we use: Titanium white, Thalo green, Prussian blue, Van Dyke brown, Alizarin crimson, Sap green, Cad yellow, and Permanent red. Almost everything is going to happen for you automatically - you don't have to spend any time working or worrying. See there, told you that would be easy. Look at them little rascals.
